This project aimed to develop a comprehensive football statistics platform that offers a blend
of historical and real-time data while utilizing machine learning to predict future match
outcomes. The project was guided by five key objectives: designing a user-friendly interface,
curating accurate and comprehensive data, implementing real-time match updates,
researching, and employing machine learning algorithms, and evaluating the predictive
performance of the chosen algorithm. Employing a technology stack that includes Django for
the back end and React for the front end, the project successfully meets its objectives.
